    "\n",
    "## What is TensorFlow?\n",
    "\n",
    "[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is an open-source end-to-end machine learning library for preprocessing data, modelling data and serving models (getting them into the hands of others).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why use TensorFlow?\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than building machine learning and deep learning models from scratch, it's more likely you'll use a library such as TensorFlow. This is because it contains many of the most common machine learning functions you'll want to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What we're going to cover\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow is vast. But the main premise is simple: turn data into numbers (tensors) and build machine learning algorithms to find patterns in them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we cover some of the most fundamental TensorFlow operations, more specificially:\n",
    "* Introduction to tensors (creating tensors)\n",
    "* Getting information from tensors (tensor attributes)\n",
    "* Manipulating tensors (tensor operations)\n",
    "* Tensors and NumPy\n",
    "* Using @tf.function (a way to speed up your regular Python functions)\n",
    "* Using GPUs with TensorFlow\n",
    "* Exercises to try\n",
    "\n",
    "Things to note:\n",
    "* Many of the conventions here will happen automatically behind the scenes (when you build a model) but it's worth knowing so if you see any of these things, you know what's happening.\n",
    "* For any TensorFlow function you see, it's important to be able to check it out in the documentation, for example, going to the Python API docs for all functions and searching for what you need: https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/ (don't worry if this seems overwhelming at first, with enough practice, you'll get used to navigating the documentaiton).\n",

    "\n",
    "If you've ever used NumPy, [tensors](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/tensor) are kind of like NumPy arrays (we'll see more on this later).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of this notebook and going forward, you can think of a tensor as a multi-dimensional numerical representation (also referred to as n-dimensional, where n can be any number) of something. Where something can be almost anything you can imagine: \n",
    "* It could be numbers themselves (using tensors to represent the price of houses). \n",
    "* It could be an image (using tensors to represent the pixels of an image).\n",
    "* It could be text (using tensors to represent words).\n",
    "* Or it could be some other form of information (or data) you want to represent with numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between tensors and NumPy arrays (also an n-dimensional array of numbers) is that tensors can be used on [GPUs (graphical processing units)](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2009/12/16/whats-the-difference-between-a-cpu-and-a-gpu/) and [TPUs (tensor processing units)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_processing_unit). \n",
    "\n",
    "The benefit of being able to run on GPUs and TPUs is faster computation, this means, if we wanted to find patterns in the numerical representations of our data, we can generally find them faster using GPUs and TPUs.\n",
